- 📫 How to reach me silvaderyl@gmail.com

-Hi, this is Daril I am a newbie to the world of coding. I never wanted to learn code, because I thought it is not for me. An year ago I had an interest in blockchain and finTech and U started to learn more about it. When started to learn about more technical aspects it was really hard for me to understand since I only had little to no coding experience. That's when I realized, if I don't know coding I am like an old guy who don't know much about technology. I don't want to be like that.

Then I started learning solidity, and when I went more technical I needed to understand javascipt. And for JS I learned basics of and css. Now I am learning javaScript. My ultimate goal is to build a NFT game completely decentralized using IPFS. I don't know if it is going to work. But if someone is reading this and have any suggestions for me please let me know.

Thanks
